Why Go?
    1. Simplicity
        25 keywords
            a. No access modifiers
            b. No classes (only structs)
            c. No inheritance (only composition)
            d. No Exceptions (only errors)
            e. No pointer arithmetic
            f. No difference between "value" & "reference" types (everything is a value in go)
        Garbage Collector is included

    2. Performance
        Equivalent to C
        Compiled to native instruction set

    3. Concurrency
        Ability to have more than one "execution path"
        Language is built for concurrency
            go, select, range, channel (data type), <- (channel operator)
        SDK
            sync package
            sync/atomic package
